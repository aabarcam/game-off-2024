STANLEY: (Nodding with satisfaction) Well done, Henry. I must say, you’ve exceeded expectations. You're... The One.
HENRY: (Breathing heavily, still shaking, but trying to keep it cool) Yeah... yeah, I nailed it. No sweat.
STANLEY: (Smiling kindly, with just a hint of pride) That’s the spirit, Henry. Fear is temporary, but the handshake IS forever.
HENRY: (Frowning, wiping sweat from his brow) That... doesn't sound reassuring. But thanks, buddy. You are one cool guy.
STANLEY: (Enthusiastically) You’re welcome, Henry! You truly are on the right path. Now, remember: every handshake brings you closer to the... deal. We’re all here to see you through to the end, Henry. Make us proud. Make IT proud.
HENRY: Don't worry, I will!
STANLEY: (Grinning, his eyes glinting) Just keep your grip steady... and your EYES open, Henry. Good luck.
