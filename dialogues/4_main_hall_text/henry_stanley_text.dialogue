STANLEY: (nodding casually, as if Henry is a regular visitor) Ah, yes. You've made it this far. Very good, Henry.
HENRY: (confused) Wait, how do you know my name?
Yeah, I mean, not bad for a Wednesday.
STANLEY
(slightly amused, giving Henry a once-over)
You’re in luck. It’s time for the next step.
HENRY
(half-laughing nervously)
Right. More handshakes. Can’t wait.
Stanley hands Henry the floral grenade, with a look that suggests he’s handing over an invitation to a dinner party, not an explosive device.
STANLEY
(seriously, gesturing to Henry's right hand)
Hold this in your right hand. Your left will be free for the next handshake.
HENRY
(eyes narrowing, deadpan)
Okay, but, uh... let me guess. If I let go of the grenade, what happens?
STANLEY
(without hesitation)
It explodes. You lose.
HENRY
(flatly) Great. Explosions. What a wonderful way to spend the day.
Stanley extends his left hand, and the handshake begins. This time, the player must twist and turn their wrist in increasingly awkward positions. At one point, it feels like Henry’s about to lose grip on the grenade—but he keeps steady.
