TRAVIS: Well, look at that. You made it, Henry.
HENRY: (Catching his breath) I—I passed?
TRAVIS: (Nods slowly) Yup. Didn’t think you’d pull it off, but you did.
HENRY: (Still processing) I wasn’t sure I could... this handshake was something else.
TRAVIS: (Smirking) Yeah, that’s the thing. It ain’t about what feels right. 
TRAVIS: It’s about doing it. No hesitation. Most people freeze up, but you... you didn’t, Henry.
HENRY: (Looking at the grenade in his hand) The grenade... that was part of it?
TRAVIS: (Casually) It’s a tool, Henry. A means to an end. 
TRAVIS: But what really matters is that you trusted the pattern. You didn’t overthink it.
HENRY: (Slowly) I just went with it.
TRAVIS: (Nods) Exactly. No second-guessing. That’s the first step.
HENRY: (A little stunned) Right. I get it now.
TRAVIS: (Leaning in slightly) You’re not like the others. You’re ready for what comes next.
HENRY: (Pauses, looking up) And what’s next?
TRAVIS: (Grinning, almost predatory) Oh, you’ll find out soon enough. Welcome to the plan, Henry.
HENRY: (Slightly uneasy) 
TRAVIS: (Claps him on the back) Oh, you’re in. Big things ahead, Henry. Big things.
